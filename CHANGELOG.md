* [0.3.0](#0.3.0)

## 0.3.0

* Added a basic permissions system.

    Server admins need a `soundmaster` and `soundplayer` role and set them 
    to be as such using `!settings soundmaster <role>` and 
    `!settings soundplayer <role>` respectively. Soundmasters can add/remove
    sounds, and soundplayers can list sounds, play sounds, etc. By default,
    anyone can do anything.
